# Ingredients
* 3.15 lbs + 3 lbs golden malt extract (1.036 ppg)
* 1 oz nugget hops (compressed pellets, 10% AAU)
* 0.5 oz + 0.5 oz citra hops (compressed pellets, 12% AAU)
* 0.75 oz mosaic hops (compressed pellets, x%AAU)
* ~3 gal + 1 c + 1 gal water
* 3 tbsp table sugar

# Brewing
1. All equipment cleaned and sanitized as usual.
2. Yeast rehydrated in 1 c water then proofed using 3 tbsp table sugar.
3. 1 gal water boiled and added to fermenter.
4. 2 gal water boiled, then 3.15 lbs malt and nugget hops added. Boiled for 45 minutes.
5. 0.5 oz citra hops added, boiled for another 15 minutes.
6. Boil stopped and pot put into ice water. Let cool for about 30 minutes, when wort was cooler than room temperature.
7. Water in fermenter remained hot, so some wort (about 1/4) was added, then yeast pitched, then remaining wort added.
8. Fermenter was closed and put into office.
9. Realized directions were misread and not enough malt added, so 1 gal water boiled and 3 lbs malt and 0.5 oz citra hops added. Boiled for 30 minutes.
10. Boil stopped and pot put into ice water. Let cool for about 30 minutes.
11. Added wort to fermenter at F+48 hours, closed fermenter, and returned to office.

# Fermentation
* Noticeable bubbles forming and gas escaping around F+12 hours.
* (First) Peak CO2 release around F+24 hours to F+30 hours.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Significant activity after second batch of malt added, second peak around F+60 hours.
=======
* (Second) Peak CO2 release around F+30 hours.
* Fermentation mostly finished by F+14 days.
* Dry mosaic hops added at F+14 days and left until end of fermentation at F+17 days.

# Bottling
1. Bottled at F+17 days, no sign of any active fermentation.
2. 2 c water boiled with a little less than 0.75 c corn sugar for primer.
3. All equipment (tubes, siphon, bottling wand, bucket, spigot, bottles, caps) sanitized.
4. Primer cooled and added to bottling bucket, then beer siphoned from fermenter to bottling bucket with lid loosely on top.
5. Bottling wand connected to spigot on bottling bucket using tube, then siphoned into bottles one at a time, firmly capping each as they were filled.
6. Filled and capped bottles placed in tub to finish.
