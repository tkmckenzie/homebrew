# Ingredients
* 3.15 + 3 lbs golden malt extract (1.036 ppg)
* 1 oz nugget hops (compressed pellets, 10% AAU)
* 0.5 oz citra hops (compressed pellets, 12% AAU)
* ~3-3.5 gal + 1 c water
* 3 tbsp table sugar

# Brewing
1. All equipment cleaned and sanitized as usual.
2. Yeast rehydrated in 1 c water then proofed using 3 tbsp table sugar.
3. ~1-1.5 gal water boiled and added to fermenter.
4. 2 gal water boiled, then 3.15 lbs malt and nugget hops added. Boiled for 45 minutes.
5. Citra hops added, boiled for another 15 minutes.
6. Boil stopped and pot put into ice water. Let cool for about 30 minutes, when wort was cooler than room temperature.
7. Water in fermenter remained hot, so some wort (about 1/4) was added, then yeast pitched, then remaining wort added.
8. Fermenter was closed and put into office.
9. Realized directions were misread and not enough malt added, so 1 gal water boiled and 3 lbs malt added. Boiled for 45 minutes.
10. Boil stopped and pot put into ice water. Let cool for about 30 minutes.
11. Added wort to fermenter, closed fermenter, and returned to office.
